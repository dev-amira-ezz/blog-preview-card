## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- I learned that sometimes trying to have perfect, semantic code makes things more complicated. I simply divided the main area into sections.
- Media query doesn't have to be very complicated.
- Classes make things very easy. I just add the same class to all the elements that I want to add the feature to.
- I practiced doing pull request in this project to simulate real life work flow.

### Continued development

I can do this project again with React. I might also use Tailwind.
